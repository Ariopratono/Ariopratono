**ðŸ“ŒAbout** <br>
Hi, I'm Ario pratono, also known as Ariopratono. I'm a Game programmer  

I am very interested in 3D games because 3D offers the opportunity to create immersive and interactive gaming experiences and can turn an idea into an amazing game. and that makes me very motivated to make it.

      <td valign="text-top">Polucity [Prototype] is PoluCity is a city-building game that requires you to build and manage a sustainable city. As you build and expand your city, you must carefully monitor and control air pollution levels. The game aims to raise awareness about air pollution in a fun and interactive way. In this project I was tasked with being a Programmer in its creation, I included, Making roads in the road I made it updated regularly so that when players want to make changes in the game, the road design will adjust to what the player wants. Making construction, in the game I made several buildings such as houses, factories, trees. each building has its own function such as houses for residences and can add pollution levels, factories to find coins and produce pollution, trees to reduce pollution produced by houses and factories. Making coins, pollution levels, population all of that will change when players take actions such as adding buildings. Making Day and night so that it gives a realistic impression. Making a save button, so players can continue the game at any time without thinking about the game starting from the beginning again. This project was completed in two months for a Serious Game assignment in our assignment we have to make a finished game in terms of its prototype.</td> <!--desc-->
<td valign="text-top">Overcook is a simulation game to become a chef who must provide food for customers within 60 seconds. In this project I was tasked as a Programmer in its creation I included, Making mechanics such as interacting with goods, cutting and cooking food, in the game you can interact with goods and then turn them into semi-finished goods, Making recipes, to help players make recipes that can be made anything. This project is still in progress. for a Capstone assignment in our assignment we have to make a finished game. <!--desc-->
